# Find That File!
 A Python based file finder!

 Want to find a file? This may help! Uses the text files in the _Resources_ folder to create a list with the file name to add well known file extentions and hopefully it will find that file. WIP.


 #### Usage:
 Load up a terminal/command prompt in the main directory and type:

 ```python FindThatFile.py```

From here follow the prompts (file type, file name and location) and the program will give you the locations of any matching files.



###### To add:
- [ ] Search by:
  - [ ] ~~Type~~
  - [ ] Edit/creation date
  - [ ] To/From date
-[ ] Search style:
    - [ ] Fuzzy
    - [ ] Strict
- [ ] Additional:
  - [ ] Supply the directory
  - [ ] ~~Add file paths to a document~~
  - [ ] Recursive search (subdirectories)
  - [ ] Open directory
  - [ ] Open Explorer showing the files
- [ ] Waaaaaaaay in the future:
  - [ ] Different OS compatability - will need to test as it maybe this by default...
  - [ ] GUI
